# MindAid
"MindAid" is basically a web application providing online mental health service system. Our project's mission statement aims to dispel myths and misconceptions about psychological problems and counseling. In our application, clients and therapists can easily and immediately communicate with one another. Users can register themselves, identify the issue they are having, and receive a list of therapists in response. Accordingly, they can pick a therapist and schedule an online session with them. There will be two types of communication channels: messaging and audio/video calling. Users can pay and access the therapist after selecting a session type. On the other side, the therapist will have access to a platform that will enable them to conduct the sessions in accordance with the convenient timeframe they have specified. There will also be some other features like a stress meter, a FAQ, and articles.
